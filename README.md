# NYT [Spelling Bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee) Solver

This is my implementation of a solver for the New York Times puzzle Spelling Bee. Specifically, my code finds the words that can be made using all 7 letters in each game's daily grid. The game refers to these as pangrams, and there is at least one pangram per day.

I ran into trouble finding a word list that resembles the one the game makers use. As the NYT does not publish their wordlist, some results may be false positives.
